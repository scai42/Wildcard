It the study of statistics and applied sciences, it is widely recognized that deterministic algorithms can be biased towards certain physical and computational problems. This is particularly pertinent in the study of human decision-making (e.g. false-consensus effect).

The Monte Carlo Algorithm provides an alternative predictive instrument, using computer-generated random sampling to obtain its results in important areas of research, computing, and other analyses. 

A simple 100-sided dice (or wheel of fortune, per se) game provides a tangible introduction to this concept for beginners. Because individuals typically begin counting at 1 (or 0), its complicating to grasp the concept that "the house always wins".

This simple program written in Python 3.0 attempts to give its users a raw understanding of the Monte Carlo Simulation by giving its users choice in how they wage their capital.
