It statistical studies it's recognized that deterministic algorithms are often inaccacurate in predicting physical and computational problems, particularly for decision problems, which can be false- or true-biased.

The Monte Carlo Algorithm provides an alternative predictive instrument, using random sampling to obtain turing results.

A 100-sided dice game provides a tangible introduction to this concept. Because humans typically begin counting at 1, they don't realize the house odds are slightly stacked against them (51:49). This program attempts to give users and understanding of this concept by giving them choices in how they wage their capital.
